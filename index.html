            <p>Tesla is a German Shepherd Mix that was born in Ireland in 2015. 
                Tesla did not have a home in Ireland so an organization called Hundarutanhem brought her to Sweden. 
                In Sweden, she joined her new family. Tesla graduated from Puppy Training School in 2016.
                Tesla now works as a family pet.</p>
